# Datastructures

Contains our Strategy class.

The `strats` folder contains our strategies - including the
MLRandomForest.

# Local championship

To run all strategies against all others run:

    python3 mandela.py

Python2 should work as well.

# Networked play

    python3 compete_all.py

Will launch a thread for each strategy and connect to a server.
